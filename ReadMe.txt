% The code is tested on Windows 7 with MATLAB R2014a.

% put the original images into the file named "SRC" firstly
% The main function  demo.m can get saliency map
% DROC.m: evaluate method "DROC" prefered in our paper 
% We reference the function of removeframe writed by Wangjiang Zhu.
% use SLIC method to generate superpixels
